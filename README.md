# Licenzio

Licenzio is a **very simple, time-saving** CLI tool that makes it easier to add a **LICENSE** file to your project.

If you're like me, tired of having to search for a license online, copying it, creating the file and pasting it into your new project every time, this simplifies it by putting it **just a command away**.

## Installation

To install Licenzio:

1. Clone this repository and open it.

```
git clone git@github.com:khalidbelk/licenzio.git
cd licenzio
```

2. Compile with the **Make** tool (needs to be installed in your system)
```
make
```

This will produce the `licenzio` executable. Run the `./licenzio -h` command to see the different usage options.
